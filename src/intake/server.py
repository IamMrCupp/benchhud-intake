"""Run the web app on a background thread, for the tray app.

``serve`` hands the process to uvicorn. The tray app can't: its main thread
belongs to the Qt event loop. So this runs a :class:`uvicorn.Server` on a thread
of its own. uvicorn only installs signal handlers on the main thread, so it's
safe there.

Qt-free, so it's tested with real HTTP and no display.
