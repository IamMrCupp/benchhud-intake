# Kubernetes

A kustomize base for benchhud-intake. It's the shape the maintainer's own
cluster runs, without anything specific to that cluster: namespace, storage
class, exposure and image version are yours to set in an overlay.

## Before you apply

1. **Pull access.** The image is a private GHCR package. Create a pull secret in
   your namespace and add it in your overlay (see the example below).
2. **The Secret.** Fill in `secret.example.yaml` and apply it by hand. The app
   won't start without `INTAKE_PASSWORD_HASH`.

## An overlay

```yaml
# overlays/bench/kustomization.yaml
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
namespace: benchhud-intake
resources:
  - https://github.com/IamMrCupp/benchhud-intake//deploy/kubernetes?ref=main
images:
  - name: ghcr.io/iammrcupp/benchhud-intake
    newTag: "0.3"                         # pin a release
patches:
  - target: {kind: Deployment, name: benchhud-intake}
    patch: |-
      - op: add
        path: /spec/template/spec/imagePullSecrets
        value: [{name: ghcr-pull}]
      # The volume is NFS: use the NFS-safe SQLite settings.
      - op: replace
        path: /spec/template/spec/containers/0/env/2/value
        value: "1"
  - target: {kind: PersistentVolumeClaim, name: benchhud-intake-data}
    patch: |-
      - op: add
        path: /spec/storageClassName
        value: nfs-client
  # LAN only: a fixed LoadBalancer IP, never a public ingress.
  - target: {kind: Service, name: benchhud-intake}
    patch: |-
      - op: add
        path: /spec/type
        value: LoadBalancer
      - op: add
        path: /spec/loadBalancerIP
        value: 192.168.1.50
```

Then `kubectl apply -k overlays/bench`.

## What not to change

- **`replicas: 1` and `strategy: Recreate`.** SQLite takes exactly one writer,
  and the login rate limiter lives in one process's memory.
- **`INTAKE_SQLITE_NFS=1` on NFS.** The default WAL journal corrupts on NFS
  instead of failing.
- **No public exposure.** This service holds customer records.

Backups aren't in the base. SQLite's `.backup` from a CronJob to a second
volume is the pattern the maintainer's cluster uses.
